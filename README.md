# Web Development Bootcamp

While I have done bits and pieces of web programming, I have always wanted to learn it through as an entire package (at least once in my lifetime..). I am trying to achieve that goal by finishing these udemy courses I bought. 

## Plan
1. Do it Everyday (weekend is optional)
2. Or at least Every Other Day
3. Note something useful on today-i-learned.md
4. Code, Test, Fix, Code, Test, Fix, Code ...
5. Project in my mind: **Creating an interactive website that has all the information about my favorites spots in New York City**
